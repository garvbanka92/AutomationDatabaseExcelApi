Mansi Dalal:



I would like to short and sweet. This is the best training videos for selenium. I have taken a classes but this is better than classes. Going in detail covering everything. Including interview questions and assignments. 100 out of 100. Buy Buy Buy.. I contacted tutor and he replied too.. What else you want.







Balaji Ramanan:



Indepth explanation.Finding it useful. I see this course to be one stop solution to selenium, appium, frameworks,DB testing . No other course provides this sort of patient explanation. Would like to appreciate the instructor's passion towards teaching the concepts under 1 course. Reason for saying so is, many commercial people would split this course length into 5 to 6 parts and make money.







Sk Amir Ullah:



Just beyond my expectation. An amazing course with in depth explanation. Whether you are a beginner or experienced in Automation just blindly go with this course.



I am enjoying the course.



The best part of this course i found that the instructor "Rahul" is very active. When you get stuck, don't worry just put your query and it will be solved with the most genuine solution within 12 hours , which means a lot............ :)

                   Apart from Selenium various other APIs are integrated as well like TestNG, ReportNG, Log4J, JavaMAIL API, Extent Reports etc which will help you a lot in designing powerful frameworks. At the end of the training you will be able to automate any web based application of your own and should be able to work on live projects.
