Nitin Gupta:



Beautifully Explained With Step By Step Instructions! We Have Come A Long Way From 2013 To 2022!! Kudos







Mansi Dalal:



I would like to short and sweet. This is the best training videos for selenium. I have taken a classes but this is better than classes. Going in detail covering everything. Including interview questions and assignments. 100 out of 100. Buy Buy Buy.. I contacted tutor and he replied too.. What else you want.







Balaji Ramanan:



Indepth explanation.Finding it useful. I see this course to be one stop solution to selenium, appium, frameworks,DB testing . No other course provides this sort of patient explanation. Would like to appreciate the instructor's passion towards teaching the concepts under 1 course. Reason for saying so is, many commercial people would split this course length into 5 to 6 parts and make money.







Sk Amir Ullah:



Just beyond my expectation. An amazing course with in depth explanation. Whether you are a beginner or experienced in Automation just blindly go with this course.



I am enjoying the course.



The best part of this course i found that the instructor "Rahul" is very active. When you get stuck, don't worry just put your query and it will be solved with the most genuine solution within 12 hours , which means a lot............ :)







Amit Verma:



I have found this course very helpful and very well organized. It is explained very well theoretically as well as practically. I really recommend this course for anyone with non some background of programming.





Ranjit Kumar:



The way of teaching is really excellent any one can understand easily event the person who are not from the coding background,I have learnt how to do code optimization and new updates tool.









                 Benefits from the Course:

Life time best support in your queries.

Get chance to work on Many live projects with in-depth framework designing and end to end automation

You should be able to justify 2-3 years of your current experience in Automation after this course



                   Apart from Selenium various other APIs are integrated as well like TestNG, ReportNG, Log4J, JavaMAIL API, Extent Reports etc which will help you a lot in designing powerful frameworks. At the end of the training you will be able to automate any web based application of your own and should be able to work on live projects. After the course you should be able to justify 3+ years of your current experience in Selenium and can crack any Selenium automation interview easily 

                   Many assignments, PDF lectures and source code for each module is available for download.
